# DiceGame
This is a 2 player game. Website is "Responsive". Everytime you refresh the page the dice is shown and the player with higher value on dice wins or it is a draw.
I have created 3 files: index.html, styles.css and index.js.
I have linked my html file with css and js. I have linked bootstrap and embedded google fonts. I have also added a favicon which is my image which will be shown along with the title.
I have added a video as my background. I have uploaded the video in this repository. There is play/pause button through which user can control the video.
I have added 6 dice images which randomly appears with the help of js which decides which player wins.
I have styled the html using css. Code has comments so that anyone can understand what's going on.
